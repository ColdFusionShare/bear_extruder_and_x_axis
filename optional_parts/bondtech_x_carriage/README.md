# Bear X axis and Extruder

## Bondtech Prusa Upgrade Extruder


### Introduction

This is a Bear X carriage to make [Bondtech Prusa Upgrade Extruder](https://www.bondtech.se/en/product-category/upgrade-kits/prusa/) with the Bear X axis.

The Bear X axis improves print quality, reliability and ease of use compared to original Prusa axis. It is stiffer, has a better tensioning system, don't need to disconnect cables from RAMBo to disassemble the extruder or access the belt and make maintenance of Z bearings easier and increases reliability.

In order to be sure exaggerated inconsistent extrusion is cured with this extruder I highly recommend to use the [Sunon fan](../hotend_fan).



### Compatibility

This Bear X carriage and X axis are compatible with original MK2, MK2s, MK2.5, MK2.5s and MK3s. However, you cannot use the Bear carriage with original Prusa X axis.
