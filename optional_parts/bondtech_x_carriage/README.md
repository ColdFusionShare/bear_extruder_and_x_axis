# Bear X axis and Extruder

## Bondtech Prusa Upgrade Extruder


### Introduction

I had the chance to work with Bondtech on the [Bondtech Prusa Upgrade Extruder](https://www.bondtech.se/en/product-category/upgrade-kits/prusa/) and with some other guys from [Prusa community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/prusacommunity/). I helped them to ensure this extruder will not suffer from exaggerated inconsistent extrusion (called issue 602) of original Prusa extruders (including R3). As bonus, Bondtech made this extruder compatible with Bear X axis and open source!

You will need a special X carriage for MK2.5 and MK3 to mount the Bondtech Prusa Upgrade Extruder on the Bear X axis.

The Bear X axis improves print quality, reliability and ease of use compared to original Prusa axis. It is stiffer, improved belt path and tensioning system, has much better easier way to manage cables/belts on the back of the carriage and reduce the bending of motor's shaft.

In order to be sure exaggerated inconsistent extrusion is cured with this extruder I highly recommend to use the [Sunon fan](../hotend_fan).
