# Bear X axis and Extruder

## Bondtech Prusa Upgrade Extruder


### Introduction

This is an X carriage for [Bondtech Prusa Upgrade Extruder MK2(S), MK2.5(S), MK3(S)](https://www.bondtech.se/en/product-category/upgrade-kits/prusa/) compatible with the Bear X axis.

This X carriage has the same features than the Bear extruder carriage.

In order to be sure exaggerated inconsistent extrusion is cured with this extruder I highly recommend to use the [Sunon fan](../hotend_fan) with the Bondtech extruder.



### Compatibility

These Bear X carriage for Bondtech Prusa Upgrade MK2(S), MK2.5(S), MK3(S) are compatible with the Bear X axis only.

You cannot use those Bear X carriage for Bondtech Prusa Upgrade MK2(S), MK2.5(S), MK3(S) with original Prusa X axis.
