# Bear Extruder And X Axis



## Introduction

This is a better extruder and X axis for Prusa i3 printer MK2.5s and MK3s. It is a following of the [Bear Upgrade project](https://github.com/gregsaun/prusa_i3_bear_upgrade) and is still compatible with original Prusa's 3D printers.

The main goal of this extruder is to improve print quality, reliability and make maintenance easier.



## Features

Here is a list of improved features over stock Prusa extruder.

1. Improve print quality: 
   * Better hotend cooling to reduce clog, heatcreap and stringing (also check these [recommended hotend fans](optional_parts/hotend_fan))
   * Filament path is aligned according to Bondtech specifications (check [this issue](https://github.com/prusa3d/Original-Prusa-i3/issues/51))
   * Extruder body is stiffer to reduce vibration from Bondtech gears
   * Reduce flexing of X axis
   * Self-centring of extruder motor
   * Extruder is closer to X rods to reduce the lever arm
   * Bondtech drive gears closer to motor
   * Includes hotend collet clip to eliminate the risk of the PTFE moving during retractions
   * Extruder shape and nozzle fan duct are makes part cooling more efficient
   * Belt path moved closer to top to reduce lever arm for smoother movements
   * Optional: X end idler for E3D Gates idler

1. Easier to maintain: 
   * No need to disconnect cables from RAMBo to disassemble the extruder or access the belt
   * Z bearings installation made easier thanks to clamps
   * Simple and precise belt tensioning system with 3mm of adjustment
   * Improved extruder body and cover assembly
   * No zip ties needed for X carriage bearings
   * Less screws

1. Improve reliability:
    * Parts designed to last
    * Better heat management
    * Vertical print fan
    * Reduce possible twist on X axis
    * Reduce chance of bad bearing alignment
    * Less screws
    * Extruder body in one piece

1. Support Prusa MMU2S multi color system via the work of vertigo235: [thingiverse.com/thing:3472911](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3472911)
1. Support Bondtech Prusa Upgrade extruder
1. Several official and community optional parts
1. No firmware modification required
1. Open source by providing STL and Autodesk Fusion 360 files (STEP file will come later)
