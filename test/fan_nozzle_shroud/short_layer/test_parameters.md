# Environment
  * room temp stable, recommended between 23-25
  * semi enclosure


# Test method
  * insert the spike in the tool with the seam facing up
  * don't push the spike in, just lay it in
  * using a caliper, measure the distance between the lower face of the top rectangle hole and the bottom of spike

If the effect is not enough pronounced increase print temp or print faster.


# Print settings for the tool

## Layers and shells
  * Layer height 0.15mm
  * 3 perimeters
  * 5 tops/bottoms    

# Print settings for the spike

## Material
  * PLA, HTPLA or HTPLA+
  * semi enclosure
  * room temp around 23-25Â°C

## Layers and shells
  * Layer height 0.2mm
  * 2 perimeters
  * 3 tops/bottoms
  * 10% grid infill
  * Seam positions: rear

## Print speed
  * 50 mm/s perimeters
  * 25 mm/s small perimeters
  * 35 mm/s external perimeters

## Cooling
    * Fan at 100%
    * Enable fan if layer print time is below 100s
    * Slow down if layer print time is below 20s
    * Min print speed 15 mm/s
